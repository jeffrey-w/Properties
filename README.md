The Properties library provides a facility for dynamically attaching new
attributes to objects. Attributes are included on and excluded from instances
in an immutable way. That is, specifying a new attribute to attach to an object
always results in a new copy of that object. The attributes defined on an object
may be queried using standard syntax.

## Installation

The Properties library can be installed using
[NuGet](https://nuget.org/packages/Properties).

## Usage

You can find a quick tutorial and API documentation for the Properties library
[here](https://jeffrey-w.github.io/Properties/).
